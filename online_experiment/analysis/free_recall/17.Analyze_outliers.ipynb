They do not have much time to get to the gate, but the security line is moving fairly well up until the TSA-type agents have a shift change that causes a delay.  While held up in line, Jessie impulsively tells Calvin that she wants to break up.  She apologizes for not telling him before the vacation.  She doesn't feel inspired in their relationship, I think.  Calvin accepts this but is hurt.  He says if she's so bored with him then they might as well break up.  They awkwardly head to their gate and the flight attendant scans their tickets annoyed.  The attendant closes the gate behind them.  They are the last to board.  They are both seated in Economy but separate.  They are three rows apart.  Once Jessie goes to sit, she turns to Calvin and awkwardly shakes his hand to wish him a good flight back to the US... and that she wants her philosophy books returned to her.  Calvin scoffs.  Story ends.\n",

Luckily, they don't remember or forget to change their flight seats and are in different sections of the plane. As they board the plane, Jessie remembers how her boyfriend still has one of her philosophy books and brings it up.
