They head to the cheese aisle and Ms Morrison says that they have plenty of varieties already and don't need Ms Bianchi's products. Ms Bianchi then says that her products are premium and people want to try premium products and not only will they increase the store's cheese sales but also other ingredients that complement it like crackers and olives. Ms Bianchi says that let us buy these crackers and Ms Morrison can try them with the cheeses that Ms Bianchi has brought with her and see for herself how good they are. Ms Morrison says done but the crackers are on her. She also picks up ketchup and some sparkling water for later. They head to the checkout aisles which are very busy with people. 10 aisles are open and they go to number 6. Ms Bianchi shows her the figures of other supermarkets that have benefitted from her cheeses and how their sales have improved. Ms Morrison says the only thing she is worried about is the high import tax. By that time it is Ms Morrison's turn to pay at the counter, and she talks to the employee there as she knows every employee personally. The total comes to $23 and she surprised Ms Bianchi by making the payment by writing a cheque. Then she says to Ms Bianchi that she thinks the deal could work as they have been trying to broaden their products to include European products and she could beat her competitor Orange supermarkets to it, and in the beginning they could order $20000 worth cheeses to get a subsidized import tax, which was more than what Ms. Bianchi had offered earlier when she suggested they buy $14000 worth. Then Ms. Morrison takes out a small bottle of champagne from her purse and pops it to celebrate the deal.\",\n",

Sven looked at the ring (2 diamonds; pink; on a silver band) and placed it into his pocket before they headed to security. After walking past the security gate, the security guard asked Sven to empty his pockets. Now, Sven proposed to Isabel in front of many people. Isabel was embarrassed by the publicity so ran away towards the concourse, leaving Sven to follow her. Isabel then accepted the proposal at the concourse, and they went on to the gate and then onto the airplane. On the way, Sven high-fived an attendant, and Isabel texted her best friend. Several passengers from the security gate who were also on the plane congratulated them, and one mentioned they live-tweeted the story and it was going viral.

Sven was sure after this trip that he would propose. They arrived at the airport with little ample time but since they did not have checked bags and online boarding passes, they were fine. Sven was nervous and fondled the ring in its velvet box in his pocket. In the line at security a man in front of them held up the line due to having forgotten some metal items on his person. Isabel went first through the security scan, then Sven. The scanner beeped when he went through, as he had forgotten the ring in his jacket pocket. Panicking, Sven dropped to one knee and proposed then and there. The other airport patrons in line started to take notice. Isabel was flustered and left toward their gate without answering. Sven got his stuff and quickly followed her to their gate. She replied of course I will marry you. Sven was relieved. She texted her best friend as they made their way toward their gate. A stoked Sven high-fived an incredulous shoe attendant. They made their way through the gate and onto the plane, where several people who had witnessed the proposal wished their congratulations to the couple. One lady revealed that she had live-tweeted the whole ordeal and showed them that it was now trending. Isabel buried her hands in her face both embarrassed and elated.\",\n",
