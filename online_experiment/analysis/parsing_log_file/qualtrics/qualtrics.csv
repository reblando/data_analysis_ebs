Whilst the female partner is in the rest room the male partner gives the waiter the ring which came from his mother and had three yellow diamonds set within it.

Once the female partner returned they reviewed the small menus which included comments from the chef.

She made a comment of how over the top the meal was for someone who brought him tomatoes 5 years ago, to which he responded they were the best tomatoes he'd ever had.

They ordered oysters and whilst eating he showered her with compliments and fond memories to the point that his eyes began to tear.

After completing their mains the waiter brought over  small cake with the ring placed in the top.

The male partner got down on one knee and proposed to the female with the whole restaurant watching, this happened not long after sunset.

The female accepted his engagement offer and then insisted on texting her father.","I really can't remember their?

The professor enters the lecture hall, and winks at Aaron on his way down to the front of the room, to which Aaron responds with a grin. The professor introduces the day's lecture topic, ions, and embarks on his lecture, using sodium (Na) as an example of how ions work. As the professor is talking, Lana and Aaron are both trying to take notes, but Aaron is also examining the ring he is about to present to Lana. Because Lana's style is more avant garde, the ring Aaron picked out for her is nontraditional; it has five red diamonds in the setting instead of one big white diamond. Eventually, the professor calls Lana and Aaron up to the front of the lecture hall to do a demonstration, and Lana is extremely confused. When they get to the front of the room, Aaron reveals the ring on a sheet of notebook paper, gets down on one knee, and asks Lana to marry him. Lana covers her mouth with her hand, and with tears streaming down her face, says, ""Yes!""

One partner, Jessie is fed-up and has decided they need to split. They are running late for their departure flight and already in a bad mood. They are held up for a short time during their security check due to a change of shift. Upon retrieving their belongings, Colin remarks that the airport infrastructure is poor and that he could have packed contraband material in his shoe. This is the last straw for Jessie (one can suppose that he is always maligning things, or that he is thoughtlessly putting them at risk with unwise public suggestions or both), and she announces that they should break up after they finish the flight as their personalities are not compatible. Colin stews for a bit, striding toward their gate with rigid jaw. He makes a few sarcastic remarks referencing terms Jessie did not say in the story proper (but might have suggested during the vacation) regarding his boring, antagonistic personality, and notes it might have been a good idea to break up before they began planning a vacation together. Having attained the gate (just in time), they are ushered on to the flight, and grateful that they forgot to book seats together. Jessie is in 33A and Colin is in 36F, a window seat. They are relieved and a bit awkward as they part - and Colin's irritation is exacerbated when Jessie asks for the return of her philosophy books.

Also, I am not sure why the Customer Experience Manager profile was in play - very little of the story was related to airline customer experience. Although not asked, if I were to list any items of concern to her, they would be:

1)Can we organize a shift change with some overlap so customers don't have to wait when they occur?

2)Will we supply the gate attendant with more customer service training, as it is not our policy to show irritation when customers are late and almost miss the flight?

3)Should we add a note to our booking policies that flag customers traveling together and take more steps to ensure they will sit together if they wish?",,

He ended the lecture by reminding students that the Final Exam for the class was scheduled the upcoming Tuesday, with subject matter on pre-Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato. He reminded students to stop by for office hours if they had questions, and also to let him know of any conflicts so they could reschedule the exam. Henry was pretty upset about Maria's intention to break up, and he said that he loved her and wanted to make it work. He was even proposing to come visit her while she was studying abroad. After some hesitation, however, Maria stood her ground and firmly said no. When the class concluded, both of them got up and hugged each other.
