Also, I am not sure why the Customer Experience Manager profile was in play - very little of the story was related to airline customer experience. Although not asked, if I were to list any items of concern to her, they would be:

1)Can we organize a shift change with some overlap so customers don't have to wait when they occur?

2)Will we supply the gate attendant with more customer service training, as it is not our policy to show irritation when customers are late and almost miss the flight?

3)Should we add a note to our booking policies that flag customers traveling together and take more steps to ensure they will sit together if they wish?",,

There were rows of desks neatly arranged. Before the lecture, Maria had planned to break up with Henry. The class was ""Introduction to ancient philosophy"". The Professor entered and started fiddling trying to connect his laptop to the projector. He began with a hearty greeting to the class. Then while everyone was taking notes for the lecture, Maria leaned over to Henry and whispered that she was breaking up with him. She mentioned that she would be going abroad to study, and that it was going to be very difficult for both of them to try to maintain this long-distance relationship. Meanwhile, the Professor taught the class on Aristotlean philosophy of choice / categories - from which our present understanding of the term ""category"" originates. He ended the lecture by reminding students that the Final Exam for the class was scheduled the upcoming Tuesday, with subject matter on pre-Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato. He reminded students to stop by for office hours if they had questions, and also to let him know of any conflicts so they could reschedule the exam. Henry was pretty upset about Maria's intention to break up, and he said that he loved her and wanted to make it work. He was even proposing to come visit her while she was studying abroad. After some hesitation, however, Maria stood her ground and firmly said no. When the class concluded, both of them got up and hugged each other. Maria remembered she had to collect her items from the dorm before heading over to the airport for her flight. Suddenly she remembered that she had left her favorite alpaca sweater in Henry's dorm room. She asked Henry to retrieve the sweater from his room and meet in front of the student center to give it to her. Henry obliged to do so. ",Long-winded story. Some extraneous fluff.,,
