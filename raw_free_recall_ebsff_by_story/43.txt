They were looking at meat at a grocery store together, for their barbeques. carina was trying to figure out what to say to simon, as she was shy, and she called the meat ''cute.'' simon agreed and they went to the checkout line together. simon paid for carina's food and carina realized she was running late for her barbeque, so she was in a rush to leave the store. the cashier said, ''i hope she gets to her barbeque on time!''

Simon and carina ran into each other at a grocery store that was big and had tall warehouse-like ceilings, with lots of boxes of food. they were both in the meat section and wanted to talk to each other but didn't really know how. carina finally decided to shoot her shot by asking a really stupid question, which was, isn't this chicken cute. simon laughed and said it was cute and how it was probably the younger brother of this other chicken, then saying what a poor family. they both had barbeques that night so they got their meat and continued getting food. carina helped simon get some peppers for this thing she recommended and they eventually made their way to the check out lanes. there were 3 lanes open and they went to number 8. they somehow were laughing so hard at the magazines and eventually simon asked carina out on a date later that week. he ended up buying her groceries for her and the total was 56 dollars i think and he paid with card. carina realized she was late for her own bbq and rushed out thanking simon who thought it was cute. the cashier rolled her eyes and made comments.
