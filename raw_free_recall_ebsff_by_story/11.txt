Thomas and sadie had been dating for a while and thomas had been thinking about breaking up with her for the past two months. they met for dinner at a 70's themed resturant and the waitress, while chewing gum, took them to a booth in the back. thomas didn't return sadie's hug and she clung to him. the two sat at the booth and thomas immediately said that he thought they should take a break from their relationship as he wanted to figure out his career path and it was hard to focus on work and changing jobs. the waitress came back and they ordered their usuals as the menu had funny names for everything and they didn't want to read the descriptions. thomas got a burger with no tomato and sadie got a rueben after asking the waitress if it was good. sadie asked thomas if this is what he wanted and said they could hang out less than they did now. the waitress dropped off their food and asked if they were going to get dessert and thomas said they were all right. sadie picked up half of her rueben and waved it in thomas' face, telling him not to follow or speak to her and that she wanted her beatles poster back. she left after crying in the booth and customer's pretended they didn't know what was going on. thomas bit into his burger and wondered if the resturant was behind the bad taste.
