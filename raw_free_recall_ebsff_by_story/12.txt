Calvin and jessie were at the airport for their flight from jamica to the united states. it had been planned before jessie had started to want to break up with calvin which occurred six weeks earlier. jessie was not happy on the vacation and calvin knew she wasn't happy but decided to act normal anyway. they went through security and calvin remarked on how lax it was and said that he could have snuck anything in in his shoe. jessie was fed up and said that they should go their own ways when they got back to the states. at first, calvin was too upset and didn't respond. they walked to their gate with jessie following behind calvin, asking why he was quiet now. calvin said that he agreed that they should go their separate ways and jessie said it was because their personalities were too different. calvin was hurt and said that he was sorry his personality bored her. when they boarded the plane with their electronic tickets, they didn't have to sit together because they forgot to get seats together. jessie said in a22 and calvin was three rows behind her. they said they hoped they each had a good flight and sat alone, glad that they could be solitary on the flight back.

Calvin and jessie were having relationship issues and seemed to be arguing about their differences. calvin was complaining about how horrible the infrastructure of airport security was. jessie was silent during this time while putting her things on the conveyor belt. jessie finally told calvin that she thought it would be best if they broke up because of their personality differences. calvin seemed to agree. the two of them walked to their gate in silence. they realized their seats were not next to each other on the plane and were seperated by 3 rows. before shaking hands formally goodbye, jessie asked about getting something perosnal of hers back. calvin was suprised by this and barely had a response for her. the two then went their separate ways and sat in their perspective seats. it was not planned to sit seperately but this is how their seats were assigned originally. they walked with each other in silence to the gate.

Calvin and jessie are at the airport after coming back from a trip together to jamaica. jessie is fuming with anger at calvin and it is revelaed that she has been planning to break up with him for 6 weeks. she thinks he is very annoying and unbearable to be with. they are in line for security and calvin states how easy it would be to sneak something past security after he takes off his shoes and belt. jessie is glaring at the conveyor belt and exclaims that she wants to break up with him. they get past security and are power walking to the gate in silence, and the only sound they hear is their suitcases clacking on the ground. they are rushing because they got to the airport with only 45 minutes to spare before take off. calvin turns around and angrily exclaims that he wished she would have considered not following through and planning this trip if she thought he was so boring, as he tries to hide his upset. luckily for them, they forgot to book seats next to each other on the flight so while they are both in economy, they are in seats 33a and 36c. they rush last second to get on the plane and the flight attendant is pissed. they are glad to  have the solitude on the way back.

Calvin and jessie are coming back from jamaica to the us. jessie has been wanting to break up with calvin for a while, since six weeks ago, but they planned this vacation before that time so they had to go on it together. calvin knew something was wrong but thought that the best way to approach the situation was to act like everything is normal. jessie couldn't handle it and decided to break up with him before boarding the flight. there was a hold up at security and during that time jessie said that their personalities don't match and they should go their separate ways when they're back in the us. calvin grabs his things from the conveyor belt and stomps onto the concourse. jessie follows saying that he finally doesn't have anything to say. calvin says that yes they should break up because she finds him so boring and asks why she planned this vacation anyways. they didn't get seats next to each other but they're both in economy, jessie is in 33a and calvin is in 36f. they shake hands and wish each other a good flight, jessie asks him to return her philosophy books when they're back in the states. they're both relieved to have the plane ride to themselves.

Jessie and calvin were just returning from a vacation to jamaica and were on their way back to the united states. there had been some tension between them for some time because jesse had been thinking about breaking up with him for the past 5 months. calvin knew something was off but decided not to say anything and continue acting like everything was normal. they were in the security line when the security guards had to change shifts, which held up the line slightly. calvin commented how the airport was kind of shitty and he could've snuck a bomb in his shoe to which jessie freaked out and said she wanted to break up because she didn't think they were compatible. calvin didn't say anything for a while as they walked to their gate and eventually said that he thinks they should break up because he's tried to appease her this whole vacation and it wasn't being appreciated. he was sad but didn't want to show it. they got onto the plane and sat in different seats, 33a and 36f. they shook hands before going to their separate seats and jessie asked for her philosophy books to be returned when they got back. calvin shook his head in disbelief

Calvin and jessie were coming back from jamaica. they had planned this trip months before, but since the past 6 weeks, they have been having issues. calvin complains that you can take anything through security here and says he could have put something in their shoe. jessie can't take it anymore and says their personalities are not compatiable. he doesn't say anything. she asks him questions but he says okay, and plays it off. they make it to the plane and thankfully they forgot to have seats next to each other in economy, so, they shake each others hands and say they'll finish it in the states. that's totally fine and such, and then she asks to take her philosophy books when they get back

Calvin and jessie got to the airport with only 45 mins left for their flight to the us fro carribian. jessie was fuming as she was unhappy. the trip had been planned a long time in advance and over the last few weeks jessie was contemplating breaking up with calvin. as they were walking towards the security checks, there was a slight hold up due to shift change. as they went in, jessie mentioned to calvin that she wanted to break up. calvin did not react immediately but felt extremely disappointed since he hada been trying to appease her throughout the trip with no positive results. he eventually told her that he is ok with it and that she should have told him much earlier about her thoughts. they did not have seats together so as they entered the flight, there were seated in different aisles in the economy class. jessie shook hands with him and wished him a great flight and asked to get back the philosophy books she had lended him. calvin was fuming but both of them were relieved that they would get some solitary time in the flight as they took off.
