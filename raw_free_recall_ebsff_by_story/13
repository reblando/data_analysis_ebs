Emmanuella and liam are at the grocery store buying food for the dinner party that they are having later that night, and emmanuella is pondering what to do as she has been considering breaking up with liam for 6 months. they are in one of the aisles and emmanuella just exclaims that they should break up. after a while of talking, they come to an agreement that they would be happier with other people. they still decide to have the party regardless and just not tell people that they broke up yet. liam does not seem incredibly devasted over it, and they are quite amiable. going to the car with the groceries, liam jokes that whoever tells someone they broke up first loses their cat, which emmanuella is annoyed slightly about since she knows that will become another argument later over who gets the cat.
