Aaron and lana are both sitting in a chemistry class, probably introduction to chemistry at an undergrad level. lana is doing calculus hw for another class and aaron is thinking about the upcoming proposal. he got her a ring that has 5 red ruby's i believe and is a bit nervous. the professor is giving a lecture about categories and how sodium has 11 protons so it will always be classified the same despite losing or gaining electrons. he calls up aaron and lana to the front of the lecture hall and lana is confused. aaron then gets on one knee and proposes, and the professor scrolls to the last slide of his powerpoint where aaron has created a collage/slideshow of the couple. the class cheers and the professor ends class, citing 'that's enough excitement for the day.' he also announces that they have a midterm coming up on the first four weeks of lecture material. llana and aaron celebreate with friends and lana also texts pictures of the ring

Aaron had decided to propose to lana in their chemistry class in princeton, in the same lecture hall they had met in three years earlier as freshmen in college. lana did not see it coming, but aaron had already planned with the professor. aaron had a ring that, instead of the usual one diamond, had five small diamonds that were red in color, in a small box that he had inside his bag. the two tried to take notes in the class where the professor explained about ions and protons, citing sodium, na, as an example. towards the end the professor called both of them down to the front for a small demonstartion. aaron got down on one knee and pulled out the ring. the professor changed the presenation to the last slide that had a photo collage of the two of them. their freinds waiting outside rushed in as lana said yes. after everyone congratulated them, and the professor gave aaron a handshake, they went back to their seats and lana texted her sister first. the class ended with the professor announcing a test on the material covered in the last four classes.

Aaron and lana are a couple, and aaron was preparing to propose to lana in their chemistry class. as they entered the lecture hall, the professor winked at aaron because he was in on the proposal. aaron and lana went to their seats in the lecture hall, and lana started taking notes while aaron was distracted by the proposal. the professor began to talk about ions. aaron kept looking down at the ring during the lecture. eventually, the professor invited aaron and lana down to the front of the classroom with the pretense that they would be doing an experiment, but in reality he was inviting them down so that aaron could propose in front of the class. aaron led lana down to the front, and then asked her to marry him, opening his notebook to present her with a ring. she was surprised and said yes. aaron's and lana's friends were waiting outside, and the friends came bursting into the room when lana said yes. the professor concluded the class, saying that they had had enough excitement for one day, and he noted that the upcoming exam would be on the first four weeks of lecture material.
