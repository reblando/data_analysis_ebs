Senna brings alvira to the nicest restaurant on the west coast... it has a view of the pacific ocean. he walks in and gives his name to the host who winks at him and sits them at the nicest table next to a huge window. the restaraunt is insanely well decorated with chandeliers, huge ceilings and windows, a beautiful view, and white fancy tables. alvira is confused why senna took her to such a nice restaurant just to celebrate the fact that she was able to grow tomatoes. all the while, he is super nervous about proposing. they order the oysters and the scallops and they find the food amazing. finally, the waiter brings out the dessert with the ring on top, which is a ring with three canary yellow diamonds, and he gets down on one knee. she is super shocked and says yes, and says that she has to text her dad the good news. the entire restaurant is watching and cheering for them

Senna and alvira walk into a restaurant with very different expectations for the night. they've been dating for five years, and senna is super sweaty because he's planning on proposing. it's a gorgeous restaurant with huge arching windows and a view of the pacific. when it isn't lit by the sun and sundown, it's light by the chandeliers. the menus are small with no mention of price on them. alvira tells senna that he's too sweet and that it's too much to celebrate her first tomatoes in her garden. senna says that they're the best things he's ever tasted. while she's in the bathroom, senna looks at his ring. it's a thin band with three yellow canary diamonds that glitters. the waitress takes their order while alvira is still in the bathroom. when the food comes, there's a cake with the ring on it and senna proposes. alvira is completely shocked, she says she has to text her dad a picture.
