Charlie waved at alma to sit next to him. he wanted to inform her about the investment decision that him and his partners had made for her start up. they were willing to put in 28,000 dollars from the 56,000 that she had requested as they wanted to invest the other half once they were able to see how the performance was. she was not satisfied with the same and felt that she would have to look for other investors and that the timeline would be severely affected since based on her profit projections, they needed to start operations immediately. although charlie was skeptical, he eventually agreed to invest the entire amount as he had received the confirmation from the investing team to allow for the full amount if needed. they hugged to seal the deal. the classroom was a large hall with 3 projectorsin the front and the professor was talking about augustus and his plans for reviving rome.
