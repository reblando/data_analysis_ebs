Mr. shelton was the cfo of a really big airplane company that was international. mr. gordon was the ceo of a small company that focused on some more tech-y stuff that could potentially affect shelton's manufacturing business. they got dinner together to discuss the business deal. shelton initially offered gordon 6 million dollars to be a part of the company which he would help they expand internationally and gordon would be the head of his branch. they ordered off of the heavy felt menus and order steak and veil. gordon replied that his business wouldn't exactly work on a larger scale etc etc and they got their food at drinks, a martini and a manhattan. shelton rebuttled with an example of a similar company and how he's made it work for them in the past. they both were unsatisfied with their food but gordon was finally convinced and he rose his glass to make a toast and agree to making a deal with mr. shelton.

Mr. shelton and mr gordon were having a dinner business meeting. they were in a wood adornred restaurant with large felt menus and candellabras at each table. mr shelton was the ceo of his airline company, and mr gordon was the cfo of his company, which was much smaller but far more technologically advanced. mr shelton offered 600 million dollars to buy out mr gordon's company. mr shelton ordered the veal and mr gordon ordered a steak. they both agreed the meat was overcooked and dry. mr shelton ordred a manhattan and mr gordon ordered a martini. mr goron was concerned that his smaller company would drown in the administrative chaos of a much larger company like mr shleton's, but ultimately mr shelton was able to convince mr gordon, likely because he agreed to keep all of mr gordon's employees, allow mr gordon a managerial position, and final say in the product development. they toasted their business merger
