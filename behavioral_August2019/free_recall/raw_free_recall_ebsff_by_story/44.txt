Leon saw ariana as she walked into his history class at college. he hadn't expected to see anyone he knew here, yet she looked familiar. they were in a large lecture hall with rows of chairs and foldable desks, with a podium and movable blackboard in front. it was a basement lecture hall in the history department, and they were starting a class on the history of egypt. their topic of discussion that day was mummies, and how complicated the whole process of mummification is. the professor mentioned how it was a really long drawn process that required experts to conduct the 70 day ritual. throughout the class leon couldn't forget about ariana, and they started exchanging notes. although she wasn't from la, they agreed to go for a walk later that day. the professor ended the class announcing that they would have a quiz on friday about mummification. leon and araina finally talked in person at the end of the class, with ariana being in a hurry to get to her next class.

They were both in the same history course and when ariana walked in leon felt he knew her. he passed her a note asking if she was from la and she said she wasn't but  maybe her twin separated at birth was. she felt he looked trustworthy so they passed notes back and forth and then made plans to walk at 8 and meet in front of her dorm. he felt he knew her even more when he heard her voice saying that she needed to go to her next class but that she would see him later.

Leon walks into the lecture hall, which is in the basement of the history building, to see ariana. he thinks ariana looks incredibly familiar, so while the professor lectures about mummification, he slips her a note asking if she's from la. she notices him for the first time and passes a note back saying no, but she might have an identical twin that she was separated at birth from. they do that back and forth for the rest of the class period, and the professor lectures about how mummification was really important in ancient egypt and it still has a lot of misconceptions today. he says that their next quiz will be a week from then on mummification. ariana has a class at noon so she has to run. leon had asked her if she wants to go for a walk that night and she says yes, meet me in front of my dorm hall at 8pm. after hearing her voice, leon is even more sure that they've met before.

Lean glanced at ariana as she entered the history classroom. it was a small room with wooden chairs and foldable desks. there were no wondows in the room as it was in a basement. it was leon's first day at school and he didnt think he knew anyone. but when he saw ariana, he felt he had seen her somewhere. as the teacher started speaking about mummification, leon kept gzing at ariana and finally decided to leave a note on her desk asking if she was from la. to that she replied that maybe her twin who got seperated from her was from there. they continued exchanging notes and leon finally asked if she would want to go on a walk that evening. she nodded as she received the note and sent back the note saying they could meet at 8 pm outside her dorm. as the class ended, they finally spoke and she told him she had to go to her next class as it was noon but she was looking forward to seeing him in the evening. talking to her and listening to her voice made leon even more sure that he had met her somewhere but could not place her.
