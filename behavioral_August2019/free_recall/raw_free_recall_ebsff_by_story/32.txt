Jeff and william are at an airport discussing business. the two met the other day at maybe a bar when they were discussing wines. coincidentally, jeff is a wine maker/owner and william distributes to large companies. the two are discussing details on potential sales while passing through security. initially william offers 800 dollars for a crate of samples to jeff, citing the amount he loses on these discounted wine bottles will be made up in potential contracts to large businesses. jeff initially nods, albeit weakly, but stands more firm after they pass through airport security. jeff is afraid of the potential losses after looking through the papers william gave him and renegotiates. in the end, jeff agrees to sell a 600 dollar shipment for 400 dollars to williams distribution, and jeff happily texts his co-workers

Jeff and william met at a party while they were on business and bonded over wine and then realized that they worked in the same industry. they decided to meet 2 hours early at the airport as they decided that they wanted to do business with one another. jeff is a sales manager and william is a representative. william proposes that jeff send him 4 crates of wine for 50percent of what he would normally charge, which he believes jeff will regain the profit of in full if even one client decides to follow through with jeff's wine. jeff is a little hesistant because he isn't a corporate vineyard, and so they come to the agreement that william will get 600 dollars worth of wine samples for 400 dollars. they are very pleased with their agreement and jeff then goes to his flight and sits in row a in business class.

Jeff and william met in a bathroom line having discussed wine. they realized they were each in the business. jeff was a wine supplier and william procured wines for corporate clients. during their discussion in the bathroom line they each realized that they were flying out of boston at the same time, and agreed to meet and discuss business at the airport. william was pleased, because he was not happy to return to his bosses empty handed. cutting the small talk due to their compressed timeline at the airport, william stated that he would be willing to purchase a sample batch of jeff's northeastern wines at a severe discount, promising that if even one of his clients contracted with him it would be well worth the investment. jeff was not pleased, as he felt the cost of such a decision would require a guarantee that a client of jeff's would go to contract. having made the same offer to jeff's competitor who turned him down, william offered to buy a sample of 5 crates for 600 dollars instead of the original 800. the men agreed to do business and william told jeff that once he landed he would send jeff the documentation. once on the plane william emailed his team the good news from his phone

Jeff and william are both at an airport in boston flying home. they both work in the wine industry. they arrived two hours early to the airport and didn't want to waste time disucussing their buisness deal. they both met the night before at a bar where they both found out the other works in the wine industry. there was a small holdup at security and jeff and william discussed william's vineyard to sell a sampler set of wine to jeff for a discount. they got through security, but had to wait for a new set of bins to arrive before getting through, and made it to thier gates with time to spare. william ended up selling to jeff for a loss only because one contract with a client of jeff's would make up for it.
