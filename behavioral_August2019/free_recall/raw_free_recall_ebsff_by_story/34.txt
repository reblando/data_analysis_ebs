Charlie and alma entered their class on archeology of rome. they were both into finance stuff and alma was doing a start up and charlie was a part of an investment group that wanted to invest in something new. they met at a party but charlie didn't want to wait until after class to make the deal so instead, they talked the entire time about their deal. the lecture hall was big and had bright likes and tables with outlets in front of the three projectors. they were talking about augustus that day. charlie offered half of what alma originally wanted to which she said no because it would move back her deadline and they needed all the funds to get started on the work that she wanted. they continued discussing and at the end of class they were the last ones to leave the room after the professor dismissed them, remind students that they had a midterm on thursday. charlie brought up the competitor something-tech and eventually agreed to invest the full amount that alma wanted. they shook hands and left.

Charlie and alma were in the same class and they charlie waved to alma so they can seat together. alma was developing a new project where she was the ceo and the founder of these web  page development and charlie had a group that were interested in financing these types of projects. they have already talked about it last night and charlie has spoken to his group. alma needed the project to be fully founded and charlie proposed to her that they would give her half of what she was asking and then depending on the performance of the project they will give her the rest. however she refused to accept that deal because she said the project wont work unless it is fully founded and if they dont give her enough funds she will have to go ask to their competitor on campus. then charlie said that it is ok that they will give her the entire 56 000 amount. the class was over and they had a midterm comming up, however they left the class satisfied and hug as a representation of closing the deal

Charlie waved at alma to sit next to him. he wanted to inform her about the investment decision that him and his partners had made for her start up. they were willing to put in 28,000 dollars from the 56,000 that she had requested as they wanted to invest the other half once they were able to see how the performance was. she was not satisfied with the same and felt that she would have to look for other investors and that the timeline would be severely affected since based on her profit projections, they needed to start operations immediately. although charlie was skeptical, he eventually agreed to invest the entire amount as he had received the confirmation from the investing team to allow for the full amount if needed. they hugged to seal the deal. the classroom was a large hall with 3 projectorsin the front and the professor was talking about augustus and his plans for reviving rome.
