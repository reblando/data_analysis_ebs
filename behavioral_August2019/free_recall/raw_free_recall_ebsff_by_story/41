Teresa was texting and ran into a glass door at a new japanese resturant. everyone turned to look at her and james was interested and looked at her over his newspaper several times before she noticed and wrinkled her eyebrows. they were both seated at the bar with a seat between them. james asked teresa if her forehead hurt and she asked if he had ever been stung by a scroprion. he worried that she had a concussion and she explained that she had been stung by a scorpion during her time abroad in egypt and hitting your head didn't really compare. they ordered their food. teresa got a salmon roll and a japanese beer. james got a vegetable roll and another roll. james looked over the menu quickly to decide and teresa took a long time. the waitress placed their food close together. james told teresa about a concert he was going to for an egyptian artist and invited her to join him. she said yes and they ate their meals happily. james had to rush off after they confirmed the plans and he knew he would pick her up. he left a fifty and said it was for both their meals and teresa waved at him with  her chopsticks.

James noticed teresa right away because she walked into the glass door of a restaurant. her forehead hit the glass and it caused a loud thud. she looked up in confusion as if the door hit her and she did not walk into the door. james inside the japanese restaurant noticed her and seemed intrigued. the hostess seated both james and teresa at the bar. the waiter behind the bar gave them menus and james seemed to decide quickly while teresa took her time looking at the menu. she ordered a beer and a salmon roll and he ordered a veggie roll with one other roll. once he realized it was 3 o'clock, he rushed out the restuarant and said he had to go. he lefta 50 dollar bill and winked at teresa saying that it would cover both. the two ended up sitting closer together at the bar and teresa talked about being stung by a scorpion. she asked james if he had ever been stung and he was confused and thought she may have had a concussion. teresa explained her experiences in egypt. the menu was in japanese but then had tiny writing in english of what each thing was

James is sitting at a sushi restaurant waiting to be seated. from far away, he see's teresa running into the window/door and he chuckles. the two end up seated next to each other at the bar and start talking. james says something along the lines of 'how's your forehead' and teresa responds 'at least it wasn't a scorpion bite.' for a second, james was scared that teresa suffered a concussion but then the conversation proceeds to when teresa was travelling and encountered scorpions. the two eat sushi/drinks and james has to run off. he leaves a $50 on the table, saying it's for the two of them and gives teresa a wink. i believe they made plans to see each other again in the future. also this scene i believe is in atlanta or somewhere georiga

Teresa was texting on her phone and walked into the glass door of the new sushi restaurant where james was. because they both were eating alone they were both sat at the bar. james asked if her head was okay she said she had been stung by a scorpion and so something like this wouldn't bother her much. they enjoyed each others company; she had a salmon roll and beer. he had a tuna roll. at 3 he had to go but paid for both of their meals with a 50 dollar bill. they had agreed to go to a concert where he would drive them.

James and tessa meet at a new sushi restaraunt. they both arrive at the slowest business time in order to check out the new fancy restaraunt by themselves. since they are both by themselves, the waitress places them at the bar sitting next to each other. james orders two rolls and she orders a roll and a japanese beer. they get to talking and begin to enjoy each others company. when the food is brought out the server purposely puts his plate near hers so james has to scoot closer to teresa. james mentions that he is going to a concert by an egyptian band that night, and then decides to invite teresa. she agrees, and they make plans for him to pick her up at 8. he immediately noticed how pretty she was when she walked in, and they clearly have chemistry off the bat.

James was reading a newspaper when he looked up and notice teresa. she was furiously tying on her phone and bumped into the resturant gate. james found this super amusing. they sat a seat across from each other. after some time james asked teresa if her forhead was ok. she asked him if he was ever bitten by a scorpian. james thought that teresa was probably having a concussion because of her odd question. he said no and teresa said that she had been and once you are bitten by a scorpian, small pains like bumping, dont hurt. they ended up talking more and teresa told him about her study abroad in egypt. james was going to an egyptian band concert later that night and they decided to go for that together. james realized it was 3pm and he had to leave so he paid for both their meals and left.
